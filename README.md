# Guess the number 

Write a simple guessing game that gives the user 5 tries to guess a number between 1 and 10.


## Problem Description
The computer will pick a random number between 1 and 10. The user will get 5 tries to guess it.

* The code to generate the random number is provided.
* You will need a loop to give the user 5 guesses.
* Be sure the game ends with a congratulations message when the user guesses the number. 
* A different message should print if the user runs out of guesses.

## Suggested Approach
1) Use a `while` loop to allow multiple guesses
2) Use `break` to exit the loop early
3) Print useful messages if the guess is too high or too low.
4) Print winning/losing messages (whichever is appropriate) when the game ends
5) There is no test code for this program. Commit and push to GitHub when you are done and Megan will test your program.
